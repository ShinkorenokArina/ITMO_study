# Task 5

**Part 1:**
1. Build and fit CNN with 3 convolutional layers for binary classification
2. Evaluate accuracy on test data
3. Plot the graphs for Loss(number_of_epochs) and Accuracy(number_of_epochs)

**Part 2:**
1. Build and fit Transfer Learning model using pre-trained VGG16-model weights from keras application.
2. Do the same with one more avaliable pre-trained deep learning model from keras application.
2. Evaluate accuracy on test data for p.1 and p.2
3. Plot the graphs for Loss(number_of_epochs) and Accuracy(number_of_epochs)
4. Check the performance of your model with the custom image of cat or dog (so the model will tell which class this image belongs to). Develop the function for the inference of the best algorithm.
